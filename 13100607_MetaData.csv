2,"Population aged 12 and over with a probability of 0.9 or greater of having experienced a major depressive episode in the past 12 months."
3,"Based on responses to the short-form Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). Respondents are classified according to the probability that they would have been diagnosed as having experienced a major depressive episode in the past 12 months, if they had completed the long-form CIDI."
4,"Provincial estimates are provided only for those provinces in which all health regions selected the ""Probability of depression"" module as optional content."
5,"When comparing estimates, it is important to use confidence intervals to determine if differences between values are statistically significant. Confidence intervals describe sampling variability and give an indication of the precision of a given estimate. Bootstrapping techniques were used to produce the coefficient of variation (CV) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs)."
6,"Data with a coefficient of variation (CV) from 16.6% to 33.3% are identified as follows: (E) use with caution."
7,"Data with a coefficient of variation (CV) greater than 33.3% were suppressed due to extreme sampling variability and are identified as follows: (F) too unreliable to be published."
8,"Health regions are defined by the provincial ministries of health. These are legislated administrative areas in all provinces except Nova Scotia. In Nova Scotia, the Ministry of Health uses statistical zones rather than its legislated administrative areas; the zones are aggregations of the nine district health authorities."
9,"For complete Canadian coverage, each of the northern territories also represents a health region."
10,"The health regions presented in this table are based on boundaries and names in effect as of June 2003."
11,"In Ontario, Public Health Units (PHU) administer health promotion and disease prevention programs, and District Health Councils (DHC) are advisory, health planning organizations."
12,"In Saskatchewan and Alberta, health regions are referred to as Health Authorities (HA) or Regional Health Authorities (RHA)."
13,"To avoid data suppression, northern regions in Saskatchewan have been grouped with neighbouring regions, as follows: Athabasca Health Authority (4713) is combined with Mamawetan Churchill River Regional Health Authority (4711) and Keewatin Yatthé Regional Health Authority (4712) and referred to as Mamawetan/Keewatin/Athabasca (4714)."
14,"The following standard symbols are used in this Statistics Canada table : (..) for figures not available for a specific reference period and (...) for figures not applicable."
